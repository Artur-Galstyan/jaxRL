# jaxRL

This is repo for reference RL implementations using [Equinox](https://docs.kidger.site/equinox/). 

Run `poetry install` to install all the requirements. Note, that these implementations may not be the most efficient. If anything, these serve more as as inspiration for what you can use Equinox.
